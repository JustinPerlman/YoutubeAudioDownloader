# YoutubeAudioDownloader

A powerful Spotify playlist downloader with GUI and CLI interfaces. Downloads tracks from Spotify playlists as high-quality MP3s with full metadata (title, artist, album, genre, and album artwork). Automatically tracks download history per-playlist to avoid re-downloading songs you already have.

**✨ Key Features:**
- 🎨 **Modern GUI** - Easy-to-use Tkinter interface with real-time progress tracking
- 🚀 **Fast Downloads** - Concurrent multi-threaded downloads (configurable)
- 🎵 **Full Metadata** - Automatic ID3 tagging with album art
- 📋 **Smart History** - Per-playlist CSV tracking to skip previously downloaded songs
- ⚡ **CLI & GUI** - Use whichever interface you prefer

---

## What you can do

- Download entire Spotify playlists with metadata and album art
- Skip tracks you've already downloaded (automatic per-playlist history)
- Download with concurrent threads for faster processing
- Use the modern GUI or command-line interface
- Track multiple playlists independently

History files are stored in `playlists/<playlist_id>.csv` with artist, title, and album information. Downloads are saved as MP3 files with complete metadata.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.9+** (tested on macOS and Windows)
- **Spotify Developer Application** (free - see setup below)
- **ffmpeg or avconv** (for audio conversion)

All Python dependencies are in `requirements.txt`:
- `spotipy` - Spotify Web API client
- `yt-dlp` - YouTube download utility
- `mutagen` - Audio metadata tagging
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management
- `requests` - HTTP library for album art

---

## Complete Setup Guide

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed:

```bash
python --version
# Should show Python 3.9.0 or higher
```

If not installed, download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Step 2: Install ffmpeg

**macOS (using Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Windows:**
- Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- Add ffmpeg to your PATH environment variable
- Or use: `choco install ffmpeg` (if you have Chocolatey)

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install ffmpeg  # RedHat/CentOS
```

Verify installation:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

### Step 3: Clone and Setup Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JustinPerlman/YoutubeAudioDownloader.git
cd YoutubeAudioDownloader

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Create Spotify Developer Application

1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Log in with your Spotify account (create one if needed)
3. Click **"Create app"**
4. Fill in the form:
   - **App name**: "Playlist Downloader" (or any name)
   - **App description**: "Personal playlist downloader"
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
   - Check the Terms of Service box
5. Click **"Save"**
6. On your app's dashboard, click **"Settings"**
7. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux:
touch .env

# On Windows:
type nul > .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your Spotify credentials:

```ini
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
```

**Important:** Replace `your_client_id_here` and `your_client_secret_here` with the actual values from Step 4.

### Step 6: Run the Application

**Option A: GUI (Recommended for beginners)**

```bash
python playlistDownloaderUI.py
```

The GUI window will open with:
- **Playlist URL field**: Paste your Spotify playlist URL
- **Output Directory**: Choose where to save MP3 files
- **Concurrent Downloads**: Set number of simultaneous downloads (4-12 recommended)
- **Start Download**: Begin downloading!

**Option B: Command Line**

```bash
python playlistDownloader.py \
  --playlist "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID" \
  --output-dir ./my_music \
  --threads 8
```

### First Run

The first time you run the application, it will:
1. Fetch the playlist from Spotify
2. Check `playlists/` directory for download history
3. Download only new songs (or all songs if first time)
4. Save history to `playlists/<playlist_id>.csv`

Subsequent runs will automatically skip songs you've already downloaded!

---

## Usage Guide

### GUI Interface (Recommended)

```bash
python playlistDownloaderUI.py
```

**Using the GUI:**

1. **Paste Playlist URL**
   - Go to your Spotify playlist
   - Click "Share" → "Copy link to playlist"
   - Paste into the "Playlist URL" field
   
2. **Choose Output Directory**
   - Click "Browse" to select where MP3s will be saved
   - Or manually type the path (default: `./newThingDownloads`)

3. **Set Concurrent Downloads** (optional)
   - Adjust the number (1-20) based on your system
   - Recommended: 4-8 for most systems, 8-12 for faster machines
   - Higher numbers = faster but more CPU/network usage

4. **Click "Start Download"**
   - Watch real-time progress in the log window
   - Progress bar shows completion percentage
   - Each song shows: 🎧 Downloading → ✅ Completed

5. **Subsequent Downloads**
   - Run the same playlist again anytime
   - Only new songs added since last run will download
   - History is tracked automatically per-playlist

**GUI Features:**
- ✅ Real-time log updates
- ✅ Progress bar with completion tracking
- ✅ Status indicator (Ready/Downloading/Complete)
- ✅ Stop button (gracefully stops after current downloads)
- ✅ Clear log button

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic usage
python playlistDownloader.py \
  --playlist "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3lQT9JB3MettQcTTrmtxRR" \
  --output-dir ./my_music \
  --threads 8

# Using Spotify URI
python playlistDownloader.py \
  --playlist "spotify:playlist:3lQT9JB3MettQcTTrmtxRR" \
  --output-dir ./edm_collection

# Using just the playlist ID
python playlistDownloader.py \
  --playlist "3lQT9JB3MettQcTTrmtxRR" \
  --output-dir ./music
```

**CLI Arguments:**
- `--playlist` (required): Spotify playlist URL, URI, or ID
- `--output-dir` (optional): Download directory (default: `./newThingDownloads`)
- `--threads` (optional): Number of concurrent downloads (default: 4)

**Accepted Playlist Formats:**
- Full URL: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3lQT9JB3MettQcTTrmtxRR`
- Spotify URI: `spotify:playlist:3lQT9JB3MettQcTTrmtxRR`
- Playlist ID: `3lQT9JB3MettQcTTrmtxRR`

---

### How It Works

1. **Extracts Playlist ID** from URL/URI/ID
2. **Fetches All Tracks** from Spotify API (handles pagination automatically)
3. **Loads History** from `playlists/<playlist_id>.csv`
4. **Filters New Songs** by comparing with history
5. **Downloads in Parallel** using thread pool
6. **Applies Metadata** (title, artist, album, genre, album art)
7. **Saves to History** only on successful download

**Smart History Tracking:**
- Each playlist has its own CSV: `playlists/<playlist_id>.csv`
- Tracks are identified by `artist|title` combination
- Only successful downloads are added to history
- Failed downloads are retried on next run

---

## File Organization

**Downloaded Music:**
- Location: Your chosen output directory (e.g., `./newThingDownloads`)
- Format: MP3 with full metadata
- Naming: `{Track Title}.mp3`

**Download History:**
- Location: `playlists/<playlist_id>.csv`
- Format: CSV with columns: `artist`, `title`, `album`
- Purpose: Tracks which songs have been downloaded
- One CSV per playlist for independent tracking

**Cache Files:**
- `.cache_spotify` - Spotify authentication token (auto-refreshed)
- `.env` - Your Spotify credentials (never commit to git!)

**Tips:**
- Delete a playlist's CSV to force re-downloading all songs
- `.gitignore` already excludes `.env`, cache files, and download folders
- History CSVs are safe to commit (just track artist/title, no personal data)

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**"Python not found" or "pip not found"**
- Install Python 3.9+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
- Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

**"ffmpeg not found"**
- Install ffmpeg using the instructions in Step 2 of setup
- Verify with: `ffmpeg -version`
- Restart terminal after installation

**"Module not found" errors**
- Activate your virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Spotify API Issues

**"Error: SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET must be set"**
- Create a `.env` file in the project root directory
- Add your Spotify credentials (see Step 5 in setup)
- Make sure the file is named exactly `.env` (with the dot)

**"Redirect URI mismatch"**
- Ensure `SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI` in `.env` is exactly: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
- In Spotify Developer Dashboard, add this exact URI to your app's Redirect URIs
- Save the settings in the Spotify Dashboard

**"Playlist not found" or "403 Forbidden"**
- Make sure the playlist is public or you have access
- Private playlists require user authentication (not yet supported)
- Try a different playlist to test

### Download Issues

**"No new tracks to download"**
- Check `playlists/<playlist_id>.csv` - songs listed there are skipped
- Delete the CSV file to force re-downloading all songs
- Make sure you're using the correct playlist URL

**Some songs fail to download**
- This is normal - some songs may not be found on YouTube
- The script continues with other songs
- Failed songs are NOT added to history, so they'll retry next run
- Check the log for specific error messages

**Downloads are very slow**
- Increase thread count: `--threads 12` or adjust in GUI
- Check your internet connection
- Note: Quality setting is "best available" which may be slower

**GUI doesn't open**
- Make sure tkinter is installed: `python -m tkinter` (should open a test window)
- On Linux: `sudo apt install python3-tk`
- Try the CLI version instead: `python playlistDownloader.py --help`

### File Issues

**"Permission denied" when saving files**
- Choose a different output directory you have write access to
- On macOS/Linux: check folder permissions with `ls -la`
- Avoid system directories like `/usr` or `C:\Windows`

**Files don't have metadata or album art**
- This is rare - check the log for "Metadata error" messages
- Try re-downloading (delete from history CSV first)
- Ensure mutagen is properly installed: `pip install --upgrade mutagen`

**Filename issues with special characters**
- Some track names have characters that aren't valid in filenames
- The script should handle this, but you may see truncated names
- Files are saved as `{Track Title}.mp3`

## Technical Details

**Download Process:**
1. Parses Spotify playlist URL/URI/ID
2. Authenticates with Spotify API using Client Credentials
3. Fetches all tracks (handles pagination for large playlists)
4. Extracts metadata: artist, title, album, genre, album art URL
5. Compares with history CSV using `artist|title` as unique key
6. Downloads new tracks via yt-dlp from YouTube (searches: "artist - title")
7. Converts to MP3 (best quality available)
8. Applies ID3 tags using mutagen:
   - TIT2: Title
   - TPE1: Artist
   - TALB: Album
   - TCON: Genre
   - APIC: Album artwork (embedded JPEG)
9. Saves successful downloads to history CSV

**Concurrency:**
- Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel downloads
- Thread-safe CSV writing with `threading.Lock`
- Downloads are CPU-bound (re-encoding) so 4-12 threads is optimal
- GUI uses separate thread to keep interface responsive

**Authentication:**
- Client Credentials flow (app-only, no user login required)
- Works with public playlists
- Token cached and auto-refreshed by spotipy

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I download private playlists?**
A: Currently only public playlists are supported. Private playlist support would require user OAuth authentication.

**Q: Why are some songs not found?**
A: The app searches YouTube for "Artist - Title". If the video isn't available or has a different name, it may fail. The script continues with other songs.

**Q: Can I change the audio quality?**
A: Yes, edit `songDownloader.py` and modify the `--audio-quality` parameter (0 = best, 9 = worst).

**Q: How do I reset a playlist and re-download everything?**
A: Delete `playlists/<playlist_id>.csv` and run the downloader again.

**Q: Can I run multiple playlists simultaneously?**
A: Yes! Each playlist is tracked independently. Run multiple instances or queue them in the GUI.

**Q: Does this work on Windows/macOS/Linux?**
A: Yes, it's cross-platform Python. Just make sure ffmpeg is installed on your system.

**Q: How much disk space do I need?**
A: Approximately 3-5 MB per song (varies by length and quality). A 100-song playlist ≈ 300-500 MB.

**Q: Can I use this commercially?**
A: This tool is for personal use only. Respect Spotify's Terms of Service and copyright laws.

**Q: The GUI shows "Complete" but some downloads failed. Why?**
A: Failed downloads are logged in the output. They're NOT added to history, so they'll retry on your next run.

**Q: Can I change the filename format?**
A: Yes, edit the `download_from_youtube()` function in `playlistDownloader.py` or `playlistDownloaderUI.py`.
