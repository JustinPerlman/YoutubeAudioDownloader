- Check that `.env` exists in the project root

- Verify credentials have no extra spaces**6. Create a `.env` file in the project root:**- `Artist Name(s)`: The name of the artist(s)

- Ensure variable names match exactly

```env- `Track Name`: The name of the song

## Tips

```bash## Usage

**Multiple playlists:**

Run the script multiple times with different URLs. Each playlist gets its own history file.python sync_spotify_gui.py



**Automation:**```Run the script by providing the input CSV file and output directory:

Schedule with cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to sync daily.



**Check what's new:**

Use `--dry-run` to preview new tracks before downloading.1. Paste your Spotify playlist URL```bash



---2. Choose download folder (or use default `downloads/`)python csvDownloader.py input.csv output_directory

## Troubleshooting

# Playlist Checkers (Apple Music & Spotify)

**"ERROR: Spotify credentials not set"**

- Check that `.env` exists in the project rootThis repository includes two helper scripts that detect new songs in a playlist and feed them to the downloader:

- Verify credentials are correct with no extra spaces

- `checkPlaylist_AppleMusic.py` — queries the macOS Music app (Apple Music) using AppleScript (`osascript`) and finds tracks that aren't in your history CSV.

**"yt-dlp command not found"**- `checkPlaylist_Spotify.py` — queries Spotify via the Web API (uses `spotipy`) and does the same for Spotify playlists.

- Install: `pip install yt-dlp`

- Verify: `yt-dlp --version`Purpose



**"FFmpeg not found"**- Automatically detect new tracks in a playlist and download them via `csvDownloader.py`.

- Install FFmpeg via your system package manager- Keep per-playlist history so tracks are not re-downloaded.

- Windows: Add FFmpeg to PATH or set path in `songDownloader.py`

How it works (high level)

**Playlist access errors**

- Ensure playlist is public or you have access- The checker fetches the playlist contents, normalizes track and artist names, and compares them against a per-playlist history file in `playlists/` (history file name: `{playlist_id}.csv`).

- Delete `.cache_spotify` and run again to re-authenticate- A playlist snapshot is also written on each run (`playlists/{playlist_id}_snapshot.csv`) so you can inspect the fetched playlist.

- For each new track the script will either show it (dry-run) or call `csvDownloader.py` with a temporary single-track CSV. Only successfully downloaded tracks are appended to the history file.

**Unicode/encoding errors**

- Already fixed! Scripts use ASCII markers and force UTF-8Requirements & notes



## Tips- Apple Music checker:



**Multiple playlists:**  - Must be run on macOS (it uses AppleScript to talk to the Music app).

Run the script multiple times with different URLs. Each playlist gets its own history file.  - No extra Python dependencies are required beyond what's needed by this repo.



**Automation:**- Spotify checker:

Schedule with cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to sync daily.  - Requires Python packages: `spotipy` and `python-dotenv` (install with `pip install spotipy python-dotenv`).

  - You need a Spotify Developer App (https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) to obtain `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.

**Check what's new:**  - Set environment variables (or create a `.env` file next to the scripts):

Use `--dry-run` to see new tracks before committing to a large download.    - `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI` (use a loopback address like `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`).

  - The script uses a named OAuth cache file (default: `.cache_spotify` in the repo) so you won't have to sign in every run. You can override its location with `SPOTIPY_CACHE_PATH`.

## Credits- OAuth tokens are cached in a small JSON cache file. The repo `.gitignore` excludes `.cache` and `.cache_spotify` by default — do not commit these files.



Built with [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy), and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org)If you want, the Spotify checker can be made to use a home-directory cache (e.g., `~/.spotify_token_cache`) instead of a repo-local file.
